# 1. Run Name (used for logging)
name: "screening_run"

# 2. Model Checkpoint
# Path to the .pkl file of your trained model.
# Note: Even though the parameter is named 'directory', it expects a file path.
chkpt_directory: "trained_models/guidance-epoch=195-metric=0.1975.pkl"

# 3. Input Data
# Directory containing your .xyz files.
xyz_directory: "test_xyz_pred/"

# 4. Output Location
output_directory: "test_output/my_predictions"

# 5. Model Specifics
# These must match the configuration used during training.
# If unknown, check the 'atom_vocab' and 'node_feature' in your training config.
atom_vocab: [H, B, C, N, O, F, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, As, Se, Br, I, Hg, Bi]
node_feature: null  # e.g., null, "atom_geom", "atom_topological"

# 6. Constraints
# Skip molecules larger than this size to avoid memory issues
max_atoms: 100

"""Dataset / collate / DataModule for OA-ReactDiff on Transition1x.

Ported from ``oa_reactdiff/dataset/base_dataset.py`` and
``oa_reactdiff/dataset/transition1x.py`` (commit 543aaa8, MIT), restructured
so the *item* is the shared :class:`~MolecularDiffusion.data.component.
reaction_data.Reaction` container and the *batch* is upstream's own
``(representations, conditions)`` tuple.

Why that split. Upstream's dataset materialises a flat dict of
index-suffixed keys -- ``pos_0``, ``one_hot_1``, ``charge_2`` -- where the
suffix silently encodes "reactant / transition state / product". That is
unreadable and unshareable: nothing in the layout says which index is the
target. :class:`Reaction` names the three roles; the positional layout is
rebuilt in :func:`oareactdiff_collate`, immediately before the tensors reach
``EnVariationalDiffusion.forward``, which is the only code that wants it.
Nothing under ``data/`` was modified to make this work -- the module is
selected purely by ``_target_`` from
``configs/data/oareactdiff_ts1x_dataset.yaml``, exactly as
``kgdiff_data.py`` and ``pmdm_data.py`` are.

The split is the published one, and it is not two files
----------------------------------------------------------

``train_addprop.pkl`` and ``valid_addprop.pkl`` contain the **same 10,073
reactions**. They differ only in their ``use_ind`` list -- 9,000 entries in
one, 1,073 in the other. So ``use_by_ind: true`` is what actually splits the
data; pointing both at the same file would train and validate on the same
reactions. Intersected with ``single_fragment``, the effective sizes under
the released settings are 6,733 train / 783 valid reactions (doubled by
``swapping_react_prod``).

The five-wide atom one-hot is derived, not stored
-------------------------------------------------

Upstream builds it in the dataset via ``ATOM_MAPPING``; here it is built in
the collate from the reaction's ``z``. Keeping it derived means the shared
container never carries a model-specific vocabulary, and changing the
vocabulary never means reconverting anything. There is nothing to convert in
the first place: the data module reads the upstream pickles directly.

``charge`` is the atomic number
-------------------------------

Upstream's ``charges`` column holds Z, not a formal charge
(``base_dataset.py:170-176``), and the ninth column of the model's ``xh``
tensor is that same Z. There is no formal-charge channel anywhere in this
model, which is why :class:`Reaction` has no ``fc`` field.

    The output is exactly what ``EnVariationalDiffusion.forward`` takes, so

    Dtypes are upstream's: the one-hot and charge stay integral and are
    promoted to float by ``torch.cat`` when ``xh`` is assembled.

    ``conditions`` is ``(B, 1)`` of zeros. The released checkpoint has

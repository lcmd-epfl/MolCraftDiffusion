"""Dataset / collate / DataModule for GoFlow on RDB7.

The item is the shared :class:`~MolecularDiffusion.data.component.
reaction_data.Reaction` container (built once by
``docs/model_integrations/goflow/scripts/convert_dataset.py`` from RDB7's
raw ``.csv``/``.xyz`` and the frozen ``feat_dict.pkl`` -- see
``INTEGRATION_PLAN.md``, Data & Pretrained Provenance); the batch is the
native PyG ``Batch`` GotenNet's forward wants, built here.

Bond union, canonical -> native
--------------------------------

``ReactionSide.bond_index``/``bond_type`` are stored in the platform's
canonical 5-class vocabulary (``0=none, 1=SINGLE, 2=DOUBLE, 3=TRIPLE,
4=AROMATIC``), directed, per side -- the container's own rule. GotenNet's
vendored ``_extend_condensed_graph_edge`` expects a **native-scale packed
union**: ``edge_index (2, E)`` over the union of reactant and product bonds,
``edge_type (E,) = bond_type_r_native * 22 + bond_type_p_native``
(``cgr_graph_utils.py`` decodes it back with ``// 22``, ``% 22``). Both
directions live only here, in :func:`goflow_collate`, per
``INTEGRATION_PLAN.md``'s Bond Representation Mapping:

1. canonical -> native is a lookup (identity for 0/1/2/3, ``4 -> 12``;
   lossless on this corpus -- 0/1/2/3/12 are the only native values RDB7
   ever produces, verified at conversion time);
2. the dense union per side is built with ``to_dense_adj``, mirroring
   upstream's ``adj = r_adj_perm + p_adj_perm`` numpy version
   (``utils/datasets.py:116-121``);
3. each side's native type is read off at every nonzero union pair (``0``
   if that side has none there);
4. the two are packed with the same ``* 22 +`` scheme.

``atom_type`` is the reaction's raw atomic number (``z``), read by
``AtomCGREmbedding``'s ``nn.Embedding(100, ...)`` directly -- there is no
fixed atom vocabulary on the conditioning side (only on ``sample()``'s
output side; see ``diffusion_goflow.py``).

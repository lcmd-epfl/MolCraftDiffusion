"""A shared, model-neutral container for a chemical reaction.

Transition-state generators all take the same thing -- *a reactant side, a
product side, and a transition state to predict* -- and disagree only about
which channel each side is carried in. This module is that shape, and
nothing more. It imports the platform's canonical bond vocabulary and
nothing from ``modules/``, so a model-specific data layer can sit beside it
(``oareactdiff_data.py``) without either one owning the other.

Three real reaction models were read at source to size this contract; every
field below is demanded by at least one of them.

===========================  ============  ============  ==============
                             OA-ReactDiff  GoFlow        RitS
===========================  ============  ============  ==============
one shared atom ordering     yes           yes           yes
TS target                    3D coords     3D coords     3D coords
reactant/product side is     geometry      connectivity  connectivity
their 3D endpoints are used  **yes**       no            no
bonds                        none          22-class      9-class
stereo                       none          vestigial     bond classes
===========================  ============  ============  ==============

Only OA-ReactDiff is implemented in this pass. The other two are recorded
because they are what makes the shape a contract rather than one model's
struct with a general-sounding name.

Two rules that are not fields
-----------------------------

**``bond_index`` is DIRECTED, and per side.** Deliberately *not* the
upper-triangular storage rule of ``graph3d_dataset.py``. RitS encodes
tetrahedral chirality as an antisymmetric directed 3-cycle ``a -> c -> b ->
a`` whose orientation is the only thing distinguishing R from S; symmetrising
or canonicalising to ``i < j`` would silently racemize a whole corpus.
Per-side rather than one shared union index, because a side has to be
self-describing -- the union edge set both siblings actually feed their
networks is ``(bmat_r + bmat_p).nonzero()``, derived in *their* collate.

**``pos`` is real geometry or it is ``None``.** Never a zero placeholder,
never a copy of the TS standing in for a missing endpoint. Both patterns
exist upstream in RitS, and a container that stored them would make
:attr:`ReactionSide.has_geometry` lie. The rule costs nothing and removes the
need for a per-slot validity flag.

Two PyG gotchas the layout dodges, both found live in GoFlow: PyG
node-offsets **any** attribute whose name contains ``"index"``, so scalar
metadata lives in :attr:`Reaction.meta` and is never named ``*_index``; and
PyG deletes attributes assigned ``None``, so optional fields need presence
checks rather than null checks once they reach a ``Data`` object.

What is deliberately absent
---------------------------

*No representation enum.* The populated fields **are** the representation;
:attr:`ReactionSide.has_geometry` / :attr:`ReactionSide.has_connectivity`
derive it in one line each. A stored enum is a second source of truth that
can desync from the tensors it describes.

*No ``fc``.* None of the three models carries a per-atom signed formal
charge: OA-ReactDiff has no formal charge at all, GoFlow folds
``GetFormalCharge`` into its ``feat`` one-hot, and RitS's ``charges`` is a
per-molecule net charge broadcast to every atom. :attr:`ReactionSide.feat`
and :attr:`Reaction.meta` cover both.

*No stereo channel -- yet.* RitS packs E/Z and chirality into bond classes
5-8, which are not bonds and do not belong in a channel every other model
reads as bond order. The honest fix, purely additive and deferred until a
model actually populates it, is one more optional pair on
:class:`ReactionSide`: ``stereo_index (2, S)``, directed, and
``stereo_type (S,)`` over a separate ``{E, Z, CHI_STAR, CHI_CYCLE}``
vocabulary. Recorded here so that day is an addition, not a redesign.

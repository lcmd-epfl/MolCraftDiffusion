"""Conformer generation -- k 3D shapes of each molecule you already have.

This is an ADDITIVE sibling of ``GenerativeFactory``, not a modification of
it, following the same route as ``tasks_gcdm_optimize.py``:
``cli/generate.py`` does ``hydra.utils.instantiate(cfg.interference,
task=task)`` then ``generator.run()``, the ``GenerativeFactory`` annotation on
that line is cosmetic, and there is no registry -- so a new class in a new
file plugs in purely through its ``_target_``. Nothing in
``tasks_generate.py`` is touched.

WHY IT EXISTS

    A conformer generator is handed a molecule and returns 3D shapes OF THAT
    MOLECULE. Run through ``gen_unconditional`` that is mis-modelled in four
    ways:

    1. ``mol_size`` chooses a molecule SIZE, but a conformer generator's size
       is dictated by its input. For LoQI the drawn size is only used to snap
       to the nearest pool molecule, so ``mol_size`` silently selects WHICH
       molecule you get.
    2. ``num_generate`` is a flat sample count, so "20 conformers of THIS
       molecule" is inexpressible.
    3. Output is ``molecule_0.xyz``, ``molecule_1.xyz`` ... with nothing
       recording which input each conformer belongs to -- and ``.xyz`` has no
       bond channel, so that mapping is the only link back to the chemistry.
    4. De-novo metrics (uniqueness, novelty) are ~0 BY CONSTRUCTION here.

    This mode asks for ``conformers_per_molecule``, refuses ``mol_size``
    rather than accepting-and-ignoring it, groups output per input molecule,
    and scores with conformer metrics.

TASK CONTRACT (duck-typed, no registry, no base class)

    A task works with this mode if it exposes ONE of:

    * ``generate_conformers(items, **sampler_kwargs)`` -- returns
      ``(positions, batch_segments)``, flat and concatenated, coordinates
      only. Preferred, and what a model whose de-novo ``sample()`` cannot
      exist implements (DiTMC, NExT-Mol);
    * ``sample(mols=[...])`` -- one conformer per entry of ``mols``,
      returning the platform tuple ``(one_hot, charges, coords, node_mask)``
      (LoQI).

    Anything else raises a clear TypeError at construction.

    The input molecules come from either:

    * ``interference.sample_input`` -- THE standard: a ``.sdf``, a
      ``.smi``/``.txt``, a graph3d ASE ``.db``, or an inline SMILES list,
      loaded by ``utils/conformer_pool.load_conditioning_pool``. A model
      needs no pool code of its own; or
    * ``conditioning_pool() -> list[Data]`` on the task -- the older seam,
      still honoured (LoQI takes its pool from ``tasks.sample_input`` so it
      can also fall back to the training set).

    ``sampler_kwargs`` is an opaque dict forwarded to
    ``generate_conformers``. Per-model knobs (``num_steps``,
    ``free_guidance_scale``, ...) go there, so this config never accretes the
    union of every model's hyperparameters.

OUTPUT LAYOUT

    output_path/
      mol_0000/conformer_000.xyz ...   <- one .xyz per conformer (what every
                                          analyze/ command already reads)
      mol_0000/conformers.sdf          <- the SAME conformers WITH bonds and
                                          formal charges, multi-conformer sdf
      mol_0000/reference.sdf           <- the input molecule + its geometry
      conformers.csv                   <- one row per conformer: which input it
                                          came from, its SMILES, its metrics

    The per-molecule directory is the mapping (3), the .sdf carries the bond
    channel .xyz cannot (also 3), and the .csv is the machine-readable index.
    Molecule building reuses ``build_rdkit_mol`` from the graph3d dataset and
    coordinate writing reuses ``save_xyz_file``; no parallel writer.

METRICS (and what is deliberately NOT computed)

    Per conformer, against the INPUT molecule's own geometry:

    * ``rmsd`` -- heavy-atom symmetry-corrected RMSD (``GetBestRMS`` after
      ``RemoveHs``), the GEOM/conformer-benchmark convention.
    * ``energy`` -- xTB single-point, opt-in (``xtb_energy: true``) and only
      if the ``xtb`` binary is on PATH; reuses ``analyze.compare_to_optimized
      .get_xtb_energy``. Otherwise the column is empty, never a made-up
      number.

    Aggregated per molecule and logged: ``rmsd_min`` (the MAT-style matching
    number) and ``coverage`` (fraction of conformers within
    ``rmsd_threshold``, precision-style).

    NOT computed: recall-side COV-R / MAT-R. Those need a reference ENSEMBLE
    of experimentally/CREST-derived conformers per molecule, and the input
    pool carries exactly one geometry per molecule. Reporting them off a
    single reference would be a meaningless number.

    HONESTY CAVEAT: ``rmsd`` is RMSD to the input geometry. That is a true
    reference only when the input carried real 3D (.sdf, or a graph3d .db).
    A SMILES input has an ETKDG conformer embedded for it, so the "reference"
    is itself a prediction -- the run logs a warning when it detects this.

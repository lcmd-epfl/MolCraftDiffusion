"""Row-aligned sidecar arrays for ChefNMR.

The platform's ``pointcloud`` batch has a per-atom array channel
(``node_features``) and a per-molecule *scalar* channel (``target_fields``),
but no per-molecule *array* channel. ChefNMR needs two of those: a
``(10080,)`` binned NMR condition and a ``(C, N, 3)`` ground-truth conformer
stack. Both ride memmapped ``.npy`` files keyed by row index and are joined
**inside the task**, off ``batch["xyz"]`` -- the same pattern
``diffusion_diffsmol.py`` uses for its shape latent, and the reason the data
layer needs no change.

Why memmap and not one ``.pt`` dict like DiffSMol's: the condition is 40 kB
per molecule (27x DiffSMol's latent), and ``torch.load`` would pull the whole
map into RAM. ``np.load(..., mmap_mode="r")[i]`` is O(1) resident and reads
40 kB per item.

Layout, all written in one pass by
``docs/model_integrations/chefnmr/scripts/convert_dataset.py``::

    <prefix>.db            ASE db; row i <-> xyz == f"db_entry_{i}"
    <prefix>_cond.npy      (R, h_dim + c_dim) float32
    <prefix>_conf.npy      (R, max_C, max_n_atoms, 3) float32, zero-padded
    <prefix>_nconf.npy     (R,) int32 -- real conformers per row
    <prefix>_meta.json     R, max_C, max_n_atoms, atom_decoder, sigma_data,
                           db sha256 + path, split, sparsity report

**A miss is a hard error, not a fallback.** DiffSMol falls back to a zero
latent on a cache miss; here a zero condition *is* the classifier-free
unconditional branch, so the model would happily emit a plausible molecule of
the right formula that has nothing to do with the spectrum and the run would
look fine. Every lookup failure raises.

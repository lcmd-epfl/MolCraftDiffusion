"""GoFlow: transition-state geometry from a reaction's condensed graph of
reaction (CGR), via conditional flow matching and GotenNet.

Galustian, Mark, Karwounopoulos, Kovar & Heid, *GoFlow: Efficient
Transition State Geometry Prediction with Flow Matching and E(3)-Equivariant
Neural Networks*, ChemRxiv (2025), doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bk2rh. Ported
from the repo checked out at ``others/nice/goflow`` (commit
``3ec00a09d9b283e3258ae01fe5d3e35bb3812bff``).

Three pieces live here:

:class:`GoFlowTask`
    The platform task contract around :class:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.
    models.goflow.gotennet.GotenNet`. ``forward`` reproduces upstream's
    ``FlowModule.train_val_step`` (``flow_matching/flow_module.py:94-99``);
    ``sample`` reproduces ``FlowModule.test_step``'s ODE integration
    (``:116-134``) but returns every draw independently, unranked -- see
    Scope below.

:class:`ModelTaskFactory`
    Hydra entry point for ``configs/tasks/diffusion_goflow.yaml``.
    ``representation:`` is a nested Hydra ``_target_`` block that Hydra
    instantiates into a real :class:`GotenNet` *before* this factory is
    constructed (mirroring upstream's own ``configs/model/flow.yaml``
    nesting), so ``build()`` is a two-line assembly, not a second-level
    dict-to-object conversion.

:class:`GoFlowTSGenerator`
    A thin :class:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.tasks.ts_generator.
    TSGenerator` subclass. **It writes no ``run()`` loop.** "Load one
    reaction, tile it to a batch, sample the transition state into it,
    write .xyz" is the shared TS layer (``ts_generator.py``) on top of the
    shared pocket loop (``pocket_generator.py``); what is left here is only
    GoFlow's own: which corpus (the converted RDB7 pickle + its
    ``feat_dict.pkl`` + split files), which collate, and nothing else --
    GoFlow has no RePaint knobs, no solver choice, just a fixed-step Euler
    integrator with one knob (``num_steps``) the base already carries.

Scope of this integration
--------------------------

**Transition-state geometry given a reaction's connectivity (reactant +
product bonds and per-atom RDKit descriptors), and nothing else.** Not
ported, each for a stated reason (see ``INTEGRATION_PLAN.md``, Explicitly
out of scope, for the full list): upstream's GT-anchored Kabsch-rotate-then-
median-consensus ensembling and RDKit-substructure permutation matching
(both require a *known* transition state, so cannot run on a real, blind
reaction); the vendored ``tsdiff/`` baseline (a separate, complete model);
``schedule_free`` optimizer mode; the model-size ablation configs; trajectory
frames. **``sample()`` returns every ``num_generate`` draw independently,
unranked and unpermuted** -- same "no RMSD scoring, no best-of-N ranking"
design as the two existing TS generators
(``modules/tasks/ts_generator.py``'s own stated principle).

Two facts that constrain everything
------------------------------------

* Atom identity is **supplied by the input reaction and copied straight
  through** -- only coordinates are generated. ``sample()``'s one-hot
  encoding reuses :data:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.tasks.
  diffusion_oareactdiff.N_ELEMENT` and
  :func:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.tasks.diffusion_oareactdiff._pad_ts`
  by import (do not duplicate them): the five-wide ``[H, C, N, O, F]``
  layout is architecture-agnostic padding logic, not something specific to
  OA-ReactDiff. RDB7 never populates the "F" column (it is a C/H/N/O
  corpus), but the column costs nothing.
* GoFlow has **no charge concept at all** (unlike OA-ReactDiff/React-OT,
  whose ninth column is the atomic number standing in for a charge slot):
  the charge column in ``sample()``'s output is zeros, full stop.

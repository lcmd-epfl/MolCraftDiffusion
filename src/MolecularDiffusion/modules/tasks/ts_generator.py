"""The one ``run()`` loop behind every transition-state generator.

A transition-state model asks for the same thing every pocket-conditioned
model asks for -- *load one fixed structural context, tile it to a batch,
sample the unknown part into it, write .xyz* -- so this is not a second
loop. :class:`TSGenerator` subclasses
:class:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.tasks.pocket_generator.PocketGenerator`
and fills its hooks once, for the whole family, in terms of the shared
:class:`~MolecularDiffusion.data.component.reaction_data.Reaction`
container. A TS model then supplies two things and nothing else:

==============  ================================================
hook            what it decides
==============  ================================================
``_reactions``  where reactions come from (which Dataset, which
                filters), as anything with ``__len__`` /
                ``__getitem__``
``_collate``    how one reaction becomes a batch of ``n`` copies,
                in whatever layout that model's ``sample()`` reads
==============  ================================================

and may override three more, all defaulted:
:meth:`~TSGenerator._label` (how the reaction prints),
:meth:`~TSGenerator._settings_note` (extra sampler knobs in the header) and
:meth:`~PocketGenerator._sample_kwargs` (the model-specific kwargs of
``task.sample()``). Everything else -- seeding, the retry loop, size
selection, writing the samples, writing the reference structures beside
them -- is inherited.

**Why the context is a ``Reaction``, not a geometry.** Of the three TS
models surveyed when the container was designed, only OA-ReactDiff conditions
on reactant and product *coordinates*; GoFlow and RitS are connectivity-only
condensed graphs of reaction and never read an endpoint geometry at sampling
time. So this class must never assume a side has 3D. It asks
:attr:`~MolecularDiffusion.data.component.reaction_data.ReactionSide.
has_geometry` and writes ``reactant.xyz`` / ``product.xyz`` only for the
sides that actually have coordinates -- a connectivity-only model gets
``reference_ts.xyz`` alone, and no lie on disk.

**What is deliberately NOT here.** No RMSD scoring and no best-of-N ranking.
Both siblings do rank samples, but offline, in their own analysis scripts and
against metrics they disagree about (GoFlow: permutation-matched, mirror-
allowed, median-consensus; RitS: none at all in the sampling path). Writing
``reference_ts.xyz`` next to the samples is what a shared loop can honestly
do; the ranking belongs to whoever knows the metric.

**Interference-key naming.** The base takes ``reaction_source`` /
``reaction_index``, not ``pocket_db`` / ``pocket_index``: a config should
never say "pocket" for a reaction. A subclass whose corpus has a more honest
name declares :attr:`TSGenerator.source_key` (OA-ReactDiff:
``reaction_pkl``); both that name and ``reaction_source`` then work, so the
shared config drives every model and each model's own config keeps its own
vocabulary. Anything that is neither still raises.

**Two ways to reach a generator**, exactly as for pockets:

* ``interference/gen_<model>_ts.yaml`` names the concrete subclass and
  carries that model's own knobs (OA-ReactDiff: RePaint's ``resamplings`` /
  ``jump_length`` / ``noise_schedule``);
* ``interference/gen_ts.yaml`` names :class:`TSGenerator` itself and carries
  only the keys every TS model shares -- the concrete subclass is then picked
  off the loaded task (see :func:`_for_task`).

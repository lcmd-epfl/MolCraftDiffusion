"""React-OT: transition states in ten deterministic network evaluations.

Duan, C.; Liu, G.-H.; Du, Y.; ...; Kulik, H. J., *Optimal transport for
generating transition states in chemical reactions*, Nature Machine
Intelligence (2025), doi:10.1038/s42256-025-01010-0. Preprint, under a
**different title**: arXiv:2404.13430, *React-OT: Optimal Transport for
Generating Transition State in Chemical Reactions*. Ported from
https://github.com/deepprinciple/react-ot at commit 6dfccd0.

Three pieces live here:

:class:`ReactOTTask`
    The platform task contract around :class:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.
    models.reactot.en_sb.EnSB`. Its ``forward`` reproduces upstream's
    ``SBModule.compute_loss`` (``pl_trainer.py:993-1004``) -- which is a
    two-line unpacking, because the bridge returns a finished scalar. There
    is no ELBO to reduce, no ``loss_0``, no ``kl_prior`` and no per-object
    ``scales`` weighting, which is why this is a fraction of the size of
    :class:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.tasks.diffusion_oareactdiff.
    OAReactDiffTask`'s.

:class:`ModelTaskFactory`
    Hydra entry point for ``configs/tasks/diffusion_reactot.yaml``.

:class:`ReactOTTSGenerator`
    A thin :class:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.tasks.ts_generator.
    TSGenerator` subclass. **No ``run()`` loop, and no ``PocketGenerator``
    hook overridden.** The loop is the shared pocket loop, the reaction
    plumbing is the shared TS layer, and what is left here is only React-OT's
    own: which corpus and filters, which collate, and the solver knobs.

Relationship to OA-ReactDiff
----------------------------

Same authors, same backbone, same corpus, same reactant/TS/product triple,
same batch layout -- so this integration **imports** rather than duplicates:
``LEFTNet`` / ``EGNNDynamics`` / ``Normalizer`` / the graph helpers from
``modules/models/oareactdiff/``, ``OAReactDiffTS1xDataset`` /
``oareactdiff_collate`` / ``OAReactDiffDataModule`` from
``data/component/oareactdiff_data.py``, and :func:`~MolecularDiffusion.
modules.tasks.diffusion_oareactdiff._pad_ts` from its task module. None of
those files is edited.

What differs is the *process*: OA-ReactDiff runs a stochastic reverse
diffusion with RePaint re-noising and ranks five samples afterwards;
React-OT integrates a Schrodinger bridge from the reactant/product midpoint
to the transition state, deterministically, in ``nfe`` network evaluations
(10 in the README's published command). Run it twice and you get the same
structure -- which is why ``gen_reactot_ts.yaml`` defaults ``num_generate:
1``.

The transition-state leak this class closes on purpose
------------------------------------------------------

``EnSB.sample`` builds its node features from ``representations[1]``, whose
position columns are the **reference** transition state when the batch comes
from a corpus. Upstream gets away with it because ``net_out_fn`` overwrites
those columns before every network call -- i.e. it does not leak today, but
only by accident, and it means upstream's sampler cannot be pointed at an
R/P pair with no known TS at all. :meth:`ReactOTTask.sample` substitutes the
midpoint into that slot explicitly, exactly as upstream's own R/P-only
deployment path does (``run_model.py:122``), so leak-freedom is structural.

Verified: on CPU, replacing ``representations[1]["pos"]`` with random noise
before sampling changes the output by **exactly 0.0 A**, and two identical
calls agree to **exactly 0.0 A**.

**On CUDA both of those become ~5e-3 A, and that is not a leak.** It is
``torch_scatter``'s atomic-add nondeterminism (``remove_mean_batch`` and
LEFTNet's aggregations) amplified through ten ODE steps: the *repeat-run*
spread is the same size as the corrupted-slot spread, which is exactly what
noise looks like and exactly what information would not. Run the leak check
on CPU, where the answer is a clean zero. This is pre-existing platform
behaviour shared with OA-ReactDiff, not something this integration
introduced.

Scope of this integration
-------------------------

**Transition state given a reactant and a product, and nothing else.** Not
in scope, each for a stated reason: the ``ei`` exponential-integrator solver
(unpublished research variant needing a Monte-Carlo quadrature per
coefficient); the other three ``mapping`` modes and five other
``mapping_initial`` values (no released weights, no data path); ``ts_guess``
conditioning (unreachable -- the checkpoint records ``ts_guess=None``); PBC /
zeolite support (a different corpus, and the part of the backbone the shared
vendored LEFTNet omits); validation-time sampling RMSD (runs a full sampler
inside the validation loop); the size-aware ``DynamicBatchSampler``; and the
GFN2-xTB-pretrained variant the NMI paper reports (no second checkpoint
ships, and its pretraining corpus is not in the Zenodo record).

    """Transition-state generation behind ``interference/gen_reactot_ts``.

    The shape of the request is identical to every other TS run -- *load one
    reaction, tile it to a batch, sample the transition state into it, write
    .xyz* -- so the loop is
    :meth:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.tasks.pocket_generator.
    PocketGenerator.run`, the reaction plumbing is
    :class:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.tasks.ts_generator.TSGenerator`, and
    what is left here is only React-OT's: which corpus, which filters, which
    collate, and the solver knobs. **No ``PocketGenerator`` hook is
    overridden.**

    **The sampler is deterministic** (``ot_ode=True``, ``sigma=0.0``), so
    ``num_generate: N`` yields N identical structures. That is honest but
    wasteful, which is why ``gen_reactot_ts.yaml`` defaults ``num_generate:
    1`` / ``batch_size: 1`` and why :meth:`_settings_note` says so in the
    header. It is a config default and a print statement, not a missing
    hook.

    The corpus filters differ from
    :class:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.tasks.diffusion_oareactdiff.
    OAReactDiffTSGenerator` in exactly one value: ``single_frag_only=False``.
    React-OT's checkpoint was trained on multi-fragment reactions too -- that
    is its capability claim -- so its generator must be able to index them.

"""The one ``run()`` loop behind every measurement-conditioned generator.

**Structure elucidation** is a different problem from the ones the existing
seams solve. You are handed a *measurement* of an unknown compound -- a tandem
mass spectrum, an NMR pair, an IR trace -- and you return a **ranked shortlist
of candidate structures**. The molecule is the unknown; the conditioning is read
per item from a corpus of measurements; and the answer is a set, not a sample.

Every existing generator was surveyed before this one was written, and each
fails on a named mechanism rather than on taste:

* :class:`~MolecularDiffusion.runmodes.generate.tasks_generate.GenerativeFactory`
  conditions on ``target_values`` -- *a flat scalar list broadcast identically
  to every molecule in the run* -- or on one reference ``.xyz`` tiled to the
  batch. Elucidation needs a different payload per output. Its size logic is
  wrong in kind too (``nodesxsample`` from a prior), and every writer in it is
  coordinate-based.
* :class:`~MolecularDiffusion.modules.tasks.pocket_generator.PocketGenerator`
  has the right candidate-set shape but is **single-context by construction**
  (``item = self._pocket()``, called once), and its output contract is
  hard-wired to coordinates (``_accept(one_hot, coords, node_mask)``,
  ``save_xyz_file``). ``TSGenerator`` rides it precisely because a transition
  state *is* coordinates.
* ``ConformerFactory`` is closest by loop shape, but its pool items are
  *molecules* (``_to_mol(item, item.pos...)``), it writes a ``reference.sdf`` of
  its input, and its metric is RMSD against that input geometry. Here the input
  is a measurement and the molecule is the unknown.

Hence a new shared seam rather than a bandaid. What differs per model lives in
hooks:

===========================  ====================================================
hook                         what it decides
===========================  ====================================================
:attr:`tag`                  log prefix
:attr:`source_key`           this model's own name for ``spectra_source``
:attr:`source_required_msg`  the "source is required" error, or ``None``
:meth:`_records`             which reader walks the corpus, and in what order
:meth:`_condition`           the model-specific conditioning payload (opaque)
:meth:`_priors`              the known-composition slot: formula / atom multiset
:meth:`_repeat`              how one measurement is tiled to ``n`` candidates
:attr:`supports_guidance`    whether this model has a CFG branch at all
:attr:`maskable_channels`    which measurement channels ``drop_channels``
                             may blank out, by name
:meth:`_sample_kwargs`       model-specific ``elucidate()`` kwargs, on
                             top of the base's ``num_steps`` /
                             ``guidance_scale`` forwarding
:meth:`_decode`              raw output -> :class:`Candidate` (3D **nullable**)
:meth:`_accept`              validity filter
:meth:`_rank`                **defaults to generation order**
:meth:`_reference`           ground truth, **or None** -- scoring is optional
:meth:`_start` / :meth:`_summary`  header / footer
===========================  ====================================================

Four constraints keep this seam general rather than shaped around any one
model. Each was checked against two structurally different elucidation models
-- one graph-based and coordinate-free, one coordinate-first -- before being
written down:

* **``_priors`` is an explicit named slot, not a kwarg blob.** Both models are
  handed the molecular formula; composition-is-known is the norm in this
  problem, not an extra.
* **``_decode`` returns SMILES plus nullable 3D.** A graph-based model emits
  connectivity and never fills ``coords``; a coordinate-first model fills it
  and reaches SMILES through bond perception. Both slots always exist. ``_decode`` is also allowed
  to be slow and to fail per candidate.
* **``_rank`` defaults to identity.** No ranking framework is built here. A
  model that votes over repeated draws overrides it (e.g. canonical-InChI
  frequency); a model with no scorer at all takes the default and is not
  forced into a no-op override.
* **``_reference`` may return ``None``.** Scoring is a separate, optional pass.
  The core loop must run on genuinely unknown spectra -- that is the actual use
  case, and an evaluation harness that cannot run without labels is not one.

Padding is deliberately *not* in the seam: it belongs to :meth:`_repeat`,
because one model pads to a dataset-wide ``max_n_atoms`` while another is
variable-size PyG.

Outputs, per run::

    <output_path>/record_XXXX/candidates.{sdf,smi}   ranked candidates
    <output_path>/record_XXXX/ranking.csv            rank, smiles, score
    <output_path>/predictions.csv                    run-level, one row per record
    <output_path>/metrics.json                       only if _reference gave labels

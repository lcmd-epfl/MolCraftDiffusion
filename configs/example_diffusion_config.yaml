# example_diffusion_config.yaml
# This is an example configuration file for training a diffusion model.

# Inherit from the default configurations for data, tasks, logger, and trainer.
# This keeps your configuration clean and avoids repeating boilerplate settings.
defaults:
  - data: mol_dataset
  - tasks: diffusion
  - logger: default
  - trainer: default
  - hydra: default
  - _self_

# --- Experiment Tracking ---
# Give your experiment a unique name for logging purposes (e.g., for Weights & Biases).
name: "my_first_diffusion_experiment"

# Add tags to help you categorize and find your experiments later.
tags: ["diffusion", "example", "baseline"]

# Set a seed for reproducibility.
seed: 42

# --- Task-Specific Overrides ---
# Override parameters for the diffusion model task.
# These settings will take precedence over the ones in `configs/tasks/diffusion.yaml`.
tasks:
  diffusion_steps: 500      # Number of steps in the diffusion process.
  num_layers: 8             # Number of layers in the neural network.
  hidden_size: 256          # Dimension of the hidden layers.
  dropout: 0.1              # Dropout rate for regularization.

# --- Trainer Overrides ---
# Override parameters for the trainer.
# These settings will take precedence over the ones in `configs/trainer/default.yaml`.
trainer:
  num_epochs: 50            # Set a smaller number of epochs for a quick test run.
  learning_rate: 0.0002     # Adjust the learning rate.
  validation_interval: 10   # How often to run validation (in epochs).

# --- Data Overrides ---
# You can also override data parameters if needed.
data:
  batch_size: 64            # Change the batch size.
